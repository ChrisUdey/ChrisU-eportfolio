            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <hr>

            <h5>Early Career & Management Experience</h5>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Prince Albert, I made Saskatoon my home for the past 12 years after graduation.
                I began my professional journey by acquiring a diploma in <strong>Hotel and Restaurant Management</strong>.
                This led to an exciting opportunity in Vancouver, where I spent 8 months working at a prestigious golf and country club,
                developing valuable management and leadership skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Returning to Saskatoon, I managed two restaurants for 6 months. However, I quickly realized that while I had
                developed strong management abilities, the food industry wasn't where my true passion lay. This moment of
                self-reflection led me to explore new opportunities.
            </p>

            <h5>Customer Service & Leadership Development</h5>
            <p>
                I transitioned into various customer service roles, where I quickly demonstrated my ability to lead and was
                promoted to management positions. My love of learning motivated me to return to school for a
                <strong>Court Services Administration</strong> certificate, opening doors to work with vulnerable populations.
            </p>

            <h5>Working with Youth & Building Resilience</h5>
            <p>
                For three years, I worked closely with vulnerable youth in the public school system through a behavioral intervention program.
                This role involved helping struggling students get back on track, teaching them regulation strategies, and
                emphasizing the importance of education. I built strong connections with both my peers and the youth I served,
                though I recognized this mentally demanding position required tremendous resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                While incredibly rewarding, this experience taught me valuable skills in <strong>crisis de-escalation</strong>,
                <strong>behavioral intervention</strong>, and <strong>team collaboration</strong> that I carry with me today.
            </p>

            <h5>Discovering My Passion for Technology</h5>
            <p>
                Throughout my career journey, I've always maintained a love for technology and built meaningful connections
                through online gaming communities. This passion, combined with my desire for a sustainable career that could
                support my growing family, led me to the <strong>Computer System Technology</strong> program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic.
            </p>
            <p>
                My wife Erin has been instrumental in supporting this career transition. When our daughter Calista was born on
                January 26, 2025, during my first year at CST, it gave me even greater motivation to excel in my studies and
                build a meaningful career in technology.
